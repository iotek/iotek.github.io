title: Problems concerning the GNU operating system

Initially announced in ['83](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/net.unix-wizards/8twfRPM79u0/1xlglzrWrU0J), the GNU operating system<sup>1</sup> has gained a lot of momentum, due to it being the default go-to operating system for the Linux kernel.

Even though initially meant as a joke<sup>2</sup>, the recursive acronym is becoming more of a reality every day.

Lets take a look [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) package.

###sort

[sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_%28Unix%29) is obviously a program meant to sort files, yet, GNU has managed to cram in a couple … extra … [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug).

Example usage of sort would be;

`ls -1 logs | sort -n`

The above command lists the directory logs/, where we can imagine there being multiple files named, or at least prefixed by the date of which they were created (or last modified).
Then pipes these files to `sort`, which is given the `-n`<sup>3</sup> flag.

`sort` holds the lines that were piped to it, then spits out the sorted output to stdout.

Seems like a simple processs, with a simple goal, right?

To most people, this is the sane way of going about it.

#####GNU does not agree.

Over the years, they've added so much code to `sort`, that it's closing up on 5000 lines.

They've done everything from trying to [steal `uniq`'s job](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/sort.c#n2969), to [making shell redirection obsolete](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/sort.c#n4474).

They even went so far as to add a [random](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/sort.c#n4143) feature.

Hold on, what?
Isn't "random" a polar opposite or "sorted"<sup>1</sup>?

You might think that GNU's `sort` is a single instance, but no, this horrifying code quality is pretty uniform among all GNU applications.

Here's another [example](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/true.c).

All this program is supposed to do is to [return an exit value of 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chneukirchen/obase/master/src/usr.bin/true/true.sh).

- [echo.c](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/echo.c)
- [ls.c](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/ls.c)
- [cat.c](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/cat.c)
- [pretty much any file in coreutils](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src)

This list could go [on and on](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/), but hopefully you get the [gist](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/log/-i).

1. Yes, it is.
2. GNU is a recursive acronym, GNU is Not UNIX™
3. `-n` is shorthand for numerical sort
